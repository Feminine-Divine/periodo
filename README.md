Periodo - The Tracker (Period Tracker) ‚ú®

About üìö
Periodo - The Tracker focuses on young girls who are going to experience their first periods and the women who face problems tracking their period dates and remembering their dates be it for avoiding embarrassing moments or to monitor your period for lifestyle disorders(PCOS, PCOD, etc.). Our application Periodo can help these girls and women by keeping a track of their periods and notifying them of their upcoming dates along with keeping track of the level of flow of their periods also helping them with their correct diet in their period days. We have planned to add more features to the application as it grows with the help of contributors. The Project is very beginner-friendly to contribute to as well as has a user-friendly interface that can help in attracting a young audience.
