## About üìö
Our project focuses on the young girls who are going to experience their first periods and the women who face problem tracking their period dates and remembering their dates be it for avoiding embarrassing moments or to monitor your period for lifestyle disorders(PCOS,PCOD,etc.). Our application Periodo can help these girls and women by keeping a track of their periods and notifying them on their upcoming dates along with keeping track on the level of flow of their periods also helping them with their correct diet in their period days. We have planned to add more features in the application as it grows with the help of contributors.
The Project is very beginner friendly to contribute to as well as has a user-friendly interface which can help in attracting young audience.
