## About üìö
**Periodo - The Tracker** _is designed for teenage girls_ who are about to start their periods, and _women_ who have trouble recalling their period dates. Whether it's to prevent embarrassing situations or to check the period for lifestyle disorders (PCOS, PCOD, etc.) this app is for you.<br>
**Periodo** will help these girls and women <u>keep a track of their cycles and **notify them of upcoming dates**, as well as keeping track of the amount of discharge of their periods and assisting them with **proper diet** during their periods</u>.<br><br>
We wish to expand the application's functionality with time and assistance from the contributors. This project is really a **beginner-friendly** to contribute, and it has a user-friendly interface that appeals to a younger audience.

## General Guidelines for Contributors üöß
### Some Guidelines need to be followed to maintain the decorum in the community.
1. Participants can be assigned to only one issue at a single time (please refrain from asking about new issues until your work in an issue is completed) So that every contributor gets an equal chance to contribute and collaborate in the project.
2. Every Participant who is assigned to an issue has to give regular updates after every three days otherwise the issue will be made available again.
3. Issues will get assigned on a first come first serve basis. Although if the current assignee is unable to give any update within 3 days. The person who is next in the queue will get assigned.
4. Please try to wait at least 3-4 days after submitting a PR. Maintainers are also human beings and have to manage the whole project. (So, don't ping constantly for review)
