## About üìö

Periodo - The Tracker focuses on young girls who are going to experience their first periods and the women who face problems tracking their period dates and remembering their dates be it for avoiding embarrassing moments or to monitor your period for lifestyle disorders(PCOS, PCOD, etc.). Our application Periodo can help these girls and women by keeping a track of their periods and notifying them of their upcoming dates along with keeping track of the level of flow of their periods also helping them with their correct diet in their period days. We have planned to add more features to the application as it grows with the help of contributors.
The Project is very beginner-friendly to contribute to as well as has a user-friendly interface which can help in attracting a young audience.

## General Guidelines for Contributors üöß

### Some Guidelines need to be followed to maintain the decorum in the community.

1. Participants can be assigned to only one issue at a single time (please refrain from asking about new issues until your work in an issue is completed) So that every contributor gets an equal chance to contribute and collaborate in the project.
2. Every Participant who is assigned to an issue has to give regular updates after every three days otherwise the issue will be made available again.
3. Issues will get assigned on a first come first serve basis. Although if the current assignee is unable to give any update within 3 days. The person who is next in the queue will get assigned.
4. Please try to wait at least 3-4 days after submitting a PR. Maintainers are also human beings and have to manage the whole project. (So, don't ping constantly for review)
5. Try to discuss your features and problems related to the issue or PR directly here on Github.
