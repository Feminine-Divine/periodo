# Periodo - The Tracker (Period Tracker)

## About
Our project focuses on the young girls who are going to face their first periods or the females who have been facing problems with tracking their period dates and remembering their dates and end up embarrassing themselves when they face their periods at wrong time at wrong places. Our application perido can help these girls and women by keeping a track of their periods and notifying them on their upcoming dates along with keeping track on the level of flow of their periods also helping them with their correct diet in their period dates. We have planned to add more features in the application as it grows with the help of contributors.
The Project is very beginner friendly to contribute to as well as has a user-friendly interface which can help in attracting young audience.
